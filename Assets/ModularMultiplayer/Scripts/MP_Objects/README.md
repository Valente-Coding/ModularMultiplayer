## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Create the Registry
1. Right-click in your Project window
2. Select `Create > Multiplayer > Networked Object Registry`
3. Name it (e.g., "GameObjectRegistry")
4. Add your networked prefabs to the registry using the custom editor

### 2. Setup the Manager
1. Create an empty GameObject in your scene
2. Add the `MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager` component
3. Assign your `MP_NetworkedObjectRegistry` to the `Object Registry` field
4. Configure settings (max objects, debug logging, etc.)

### 3. Add to Network Prefabs
1. In your `NetworkManager`, add the `MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager` prefab to the Network Prefabs list
2. Ensure all your spawnable prefabs are also in the Network Prefabs list

### 4. (Optional) Add Example Spawner
1. Add the `MP_NetworkedObjectSpawner` component to test the system
2. Configure spawn points and input keys
3. Assign the same registry used by the manager

## üíª Usage Examples

### Basic Spawning
```csharp
// Spawn an object by prefab ID
MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager.Instance.SpawnNetworkedObject(
    prefabId: 0, 
    position: Vector3.zero, 
    rotation: Quaternion.identity, 
    ownerClientId: NetworkManager.Singleton.LocalClientId
);
```

### Destroying Objects
```csharp
// Destroy a specific object
MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager.Instance.DestroyNetworkedObject(networkObject);
```

### Ownership Management
```csharp
// Transfer ownership to another client
MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager.Instance.ChangeObjectOwnership(networkObject, newOwnerClientId);

// Get all objects owned by a client
var ownedObjects = MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager.Instance.GetObjectsOwnedByClient(clientId);
```

### Object Manipulation
```csharp
// Teleport an object
MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager.Instance.TeleportObject(networkObject, newPosition);

// Set active state
MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager.Instance.SetObjectActive(networkObject, false);
```

### Event Handling
```csharp
void Start()
{
    // Subscribe to events
    MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager.Instance.OnGameObjectSpawned += OnObjectSpawned;
    MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager.Instance.OnGameObjectDestroyed += OnObjectDestroyed;
    MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager.Instance.OnOwnershipChanged += OnOwnershipChanged;
}

private void OnObjectSpawned(object sender, MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager.OnGameObjectSpawnedEventArgs e)
{
    Debug.Log($"Object spawned: {e.spawnedObject.name} by client {e.ownerClientId}");
}
```

## üéÆ Testing Controls (MP_NetworkedObjectSpawner)

When using the example `MP_NetworkedObjectSpawner`:

- **G Key** - Spawn a random object
- **H Key** - Destroy a random object
- **J Key** - Teleport a random object

## üìã Registry Management

The `MP_NetworkedObjectRegistry` provides a custom Unity Editor with these features:

### Adding Prefabs
1. Enter a name for your prefab entry
2. Drag your prefab (must have NetworkObject component)
3. Add an optional description
4. Click "Add Prefab to Registry"

### Management Tools
- **Validate Registry** - Removes invalid entries and checks for issues
- **Regenerate IDs** - Reassigns all prefab IDs sequentially
- **Clear Cache** - Clears the runtime lookup cache
- **Sort by Name** - Alphabetically sorts all entries

### Validation
The editor automatically warns about:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing NetworkObject components
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate prefab IDs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate prefab references
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing prefab references

## üîß Configuration Options

### MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager Settings
- **Enable Debug Logs** - Show detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Max Managed Objects** - Maximum number of objects that can be managed (performance limit)
- **Object Registry** - Reference to your MP_NetworkedObjectRegistry

### MP_NetworkedObjectSpawner Settings
- **Auto Spawn on Start** - Automatically spawn objects when the game starts
- **Auto Spawn Count** - Maximum number of objects to auto-spawn
- **Auto Spawn Interval** - Time between auto-spawns
- **Spawn Points** - Predefined locations for spawning
- **Spawn Radius** - Random offset range for spawning

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns

### Server Authority
- All spawn/destroy operations go through the server
- Server validates all requests before execution
- Server handles client disconnections automatically

### Client Ownership
- Each object has an owner client
- Owner can request operations on their objects
- Ownership can be transferred between clients

### Event-Driven Design
- All major operations trigger events
- Easy to extend with custom behaviors
- Loose coupling between components

### Caching Strategy
- Runtime caches for fast lookups
- Automatic cache invalidation
- Memory-efficient storage

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Objects not spawning:**
- Ensure prefabs are in the NetworkManager's Network Prefabs list
- Check that prefabs have NetworkObject components
- Verify the MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager is spawned as a NetworkObject

**Registry not working:**
- Make sure the registry is assigned to the manager
- Check for validation errors in the registry editor
- Ensure prefab IDs are unique

**Events not firing:**
- Subscribe to events after MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager.Instance is available
- Check that the manager is properly spawned on the network

**Performance issues:**
- Reduce the max managed objects limit
- Disable debug logging in production
- Consider pooling for frequently spawned objects

### Debug Information

Enable debug logs in the MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager to see:
- Object spawn/destroy operations
- Ownership changes
- Client disconnect cleanup
- Cache operations

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Code

This system is designed to work alongside the existing kitchen game architecture:

### Similar to KitchenObject Pattern
```csharp
// Instead of KitchenObject.SpawnKitchenObject()
MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager.Instance.SpawnNetworkedObject(prefabId, position, rotation, ownerId);

// Instead of KitchenObject.DestroyKitchenObject()
MP_NetworkedGameObjectManager.Instance.DestroyNetworkedObject(networkObject);
```

### Works with Existing NetworkBehaviour Classes
Your existing NetworkBehaviour scripts will work normally with spawned objects. The manager handles the spawning/despawning, while your scripts handle the behavior.

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips
1. **Limit Max Objects** - Set reasonable limits based on your game's needs
2. **Use Object Pooling** - For frequently spawned/destroyed objects
3. **Batch Operations** - Group multiple spawns together when possible
4. **Cleanup Strategy** - Regular cleanup of unused objects

### Memory Usage
- Each managed object stores ~64 bytes of metadata
- Registry cache is built once and reused
- Event subscriptions should be properly unsubscribed

## ü§ù Contributing

This system follows the patterns established in the reference code:
- Uses Unity Netcode for GameObjects
- Follows the ServerRpc/ClientRpc pattern
- Implements singleton pattern for global access
- Uses events for decoupled communication

Feel free to extend the system with additional features like:
- Object pooling integration
- Custom serialization for complex data
- Integration with game-specific managers
- Additional validation rules
